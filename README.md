I created this application to practice my ReactJS skills. 
You can check out the live app on: https://chewie-wisdom.netlify.com/

Or in case you want to check it locally, just make sure you have yarn installed, then:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
